Subject: [PATCH 02/31] ARM64: dts: amlogic: Add basic support for Amlogic
 S905X
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This patch introduces the basic support for the Amlogic S905X (Meson
GXL) and for the Amlogic evaluation board P212.
No documentation has been released yet for this SoC, so for now only the
bare minimum has been added in the DT.
